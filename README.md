The main objective of the project is to build a
recommendation system for retail store owners in order to
provide them with insights into what may be the necessary
steps that need to be taken to increase profits and help them
in identifying all the necessary steps and adopt strategies to
minimize expenses by identifying the products that are high in
demand in the market and take the longest to sell. The model
gives recommendations to the reatil store owner based on the analysis of
customer purchase activity of an item like transaction history, frequency of selling a product, recency of transaction, monetary values etc.
